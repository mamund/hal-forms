# Suggest Control Working Document


## Summary
The need for a `HTML.SELECT`-type control for **HAL-FORMS** has been clear for quite a while. After several excellent attempts, this is an effort aimed at knocking out a workable solution ASAP. It might not meet all needs right away, but hopefully it is useful and, if needed, can be expanded down the line.

The hope is that we can commit an acceptable version of this feature with the next several days.

This doc is here to allow people to review and comment on the initial design. 

### Background Material
Various design options have been offered for this UI element. Below is a list of some of the background material used in creating this design:

 * Github issue: https://github.com/mamund/hal-forms/issues/9
 * Additional considerations: https://gist.github.com/odrotbohm/6edb70220950b3d474092be13989efe7
 * WeSTL Suggest: http://rwcbook.github.io/wstl-spec/#_suggest_arrays

### Proposed **HAL-FORMS** SUGGEST
The motivation for the control is to provide an enumerated list of possible values for a `property`. This can be used to provide a UI similar to HTML controls such as 

 * `SELECT & OPTIONS`
 * `INPUT.type="radio"`
 * `INPUT.type="checkbox"`
 * `INPUT.type="search"` (w/ type-ahead suggestions)

#### General Functionality
The `suggest` object is a child of `property`. It contains a set of possible values accessible either byValue (e.g. `inline`) or byReference (e.g. via `resource.href`). The `suggest` control can be rendered as a fixed dropdown list (`type="dropdown"`), a set of radio buttons (`type="radio"`), a series of checkboxes (`type=checkbox"`), or as an open field that supports type-ahead autocompletion (`type="search"`). Whatever value is ultimately selected gets placed into the `property.value` attribute. If the **HAL-FORMS** template has a pre-set value in the corresponding `property.value` attribute, the UI can render the form with "pre-selected" value(s) already selected.

There are a number of possible "renditions" of the `suggest` feature. This spec covers the following:

 * SUGGEST with a Simple Inline Array of Values
 * SUGGEST with an Inline Array of Name/Value Pairs
 * SUGGEST with an External Array of Values
 * SUGGEST with an External Array of Name/Value Pairs
 * SUGGEST with Reference Fields
 * SUGGEST with Multiple Return Values
 * SUGGEST with Type-Ahead/Auto-Completion Support

#### SUGGEST with a Simple Inline Array of Values
Below is a simple rendition of the `suggest` control using the _Inline Array_ style.  Note that, in the example below control's default value would be set to "FedEx".

```javascript
{
  "_templates" : {
    "default" : {
      ...
      "properties" : [
        {
          "name" : "shipping", 
          "type" : "dropdown",
          "value" : "FedEx", 
          "prompt" : "Select Shipping Method", 
          "suggest" : {
            "inline" : ["FedEx","UPS","DHL","Prime"]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

A corresponding `HTML.SELECT` rendering looks like this:

```html
<label for="shipping">Select Shipping Method</label>
<select name="shipping">
  <option selected="true">FedEx</option>
  <option>UPS</option>
  <option>DHL</option>
</select>
```

#### SUGGEST with an Inline Array of Name/Value Pairs
Below is an example of the `suggest` control using an _Inline Array of Name/Value Paris_.

```javascript
{
  "_templates" : {
    "default" : {
      ...
      "properties" : [
        {
          "name" : "shipping", 
          "type" : "radio",
          "value" : "FedEx", 
          "prompt" : "Select Shipping Method", 
          "suggest" : {
            "inline" : [
              {"prompt" : "Federal Express", "value" : "FedEx"},
              {"prompt" : "United Parcel Service", "value" : "UPS"},
              {"prompt" : "DHL Express", "value" : "DHL"},
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

A corresponding `HTML.INPUT.type="radio"` rendering looks like this:

```html
<p>
  <input type="radio" id="fedex" name="shipping" value="FedEx" checked="true">
  <label for="fedex">Federal Express</label><br>
  
  <input type="radio" id="ups" name="shipping" value="UPS">
  <label for="ups">United Parcel Service</label><br>
  
  <input type="radio" id="dhl" name="shipping" value="DHL">
  <label for="dhl">DHL Express</label>
</p>
```

#### SUGGEST with an External Array of Values
The source of possible values for a `suggest` control can also be an external resource. This resource is reachable using an `HTML.GET` against a supplied URL (which MAY be templated) and and OPTIONAL `accept` property that holds a valid registered media type (e.g. `text/csv`, `application/json`, etc.). 

By default, the response value is a _Simple Array_ rendered in `text/csv` as a set of CR/LF-separated values.

```javascript
{
  "_templates" : {
    "default" : {
      ...
      "properties" : [
        {
          "name" : "shipping", 
          "value" : "FedEx", 
          "type" : "radio",
          "prompt" : "Select Shipping Method", 
          "suggest" : {
            "resource" : {
              "href" : "http://api.examples.org/shipping-options",
              "templated" : "false",
              "accept" : "text/csv"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The client would dereference the URL using `HTTP.GET`. The exchange (including the response) looks like this:


```
*** REQUEST
GET /shipping-options HTTP/2.0
Host: api.example.org
Accept: text/csv

*** RESPONSE
HTTP/2.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/csv
Content-Length: nn

Fedex
UPS
DHL
```

An array of values MAY be returned as a simple JSON array if the `suggest.accept` attribute is set to `application/json`

```
*** REQUEST
GET /shipping-options HTTP/2.0
Host: api.example.org
Accept: application/json

*** RESPONSE
HTTP/2.0 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: nn

["Fedex","UPS","DHL"]
```

#### SUGGEST with an External Array of Name/Value Pairs
The external resource MAY return a collection of name/value pairs.

```javascript
{
  "_templates" : {
    "default" : {
      ...
      "properties" : [
        {
          "name" : "shipping", 
          "value" : "FedEx", 
          "type" : "dropdown",
          "prompt" : "Select Shipping Method", 
          "suggest" : {
            "resource" : {
              "href" : "http://api.examples.org/shipping-options",
              "templated" : "false",
              "accept : "text/csv"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The client would dereference the URL using `HTTP.GET`. The exchange (including the response) looks like this:

```
*** REQUEST
GET /shipping-options HTTP/2.0
Host: api.example.org
Accept: text/csv

*** RESPONSE
HTTP/2.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/csv
Content-Length: nn

Federal Express,FedEx
United Parcel Service,UPS
DHL Express,DHL
```

An array of name/value pairs MAY be returned as a an array of JSON objects if the `suggest.accept` attribute is set to `application/json`

```
*** REQUEST
GET /shipping-options HTTP/2.0
Host: api.example.org
Accept: application/json

*** RESPONSE
HTTP/2.0 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: nn

[
  {"prompt" : "Federal Express", "value" : "FedEx"},
  {"prompt" : "United Parcel Service", "value" : "UPS"},
  {"prompt" : "DHL Express", "value" : "DHL"},
]
```

#### SUGGEST with Reference Fields
The `suggest` element also supports the use of `suggest.promptField` and `suggest.valueField` as custom property names  or _Reference Fields_ instead of using the default `prompt` and `value` names.  In this case, the `promptField` value contains the name of the field in the source collection (`inline` or `resource`) to be used for prompts and the `valueField` value contains the name of the field in the source collection to be used for values.

```javascript
{
  "_templates" : {
    "default" : {
      ...
      "properties" : [
        {
          "name" : "shipping", 
          "value" : "FedEx", 
          "type" : "radio",
          "prompt" : "Select Shipping Method", 
          "suggest" : {
            "inline" : [
              {"shipName" : "Federal Express", "shipCode" : "FedEx"},
              {"shipName" : "United Parcel Service", "shipCode" : "UPS"},
              {"shipName" : "DHL Express", "shipCode" : "DHL"},
            ],
            "promptField" : "shipName",
            "valueField" : "shipCode"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

_Reference Fields_ MAY be used when returning an array of JSON objects if the `suggest.accept` attribute is set to `application/json`

```
*** REQUEST
GET /shipping-options HTTP/2.0
Host: api.example.org
Accept: application/json

*** RESPONSE
HTTP/2.0 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: nn

[
  {"shipName" : "Federal Express", "shipCode" : "FedEx"},
  {"shipName" : "United Parcel Service", "shipCode" : "UPS"},
  {"shipName" : "DHL Express", "shipCode" : "DHL"},
]
```

#### SUGGEST with Multiple Return Values
When the `suggest.multiple` attribute is set to `true`, client applications SHOULD support selecting more than one of the suggested values. This can apply whether the source list comes from `inline` or `resource`.


```javascript
{
  "_templates" : {
    "default" : {
      ...
      "properties" : [
        {
          "name" : "shipping", 
          "type" : "checkbox",
          "value" : "FedEx", 
          "prompt" : "Select Shipping Method", 
          "multiple" : "true",
          "promptField" : "shipName",
          "valueField" : "shipCode",
          "suggest" : {
            "inline" : [
              {"shipName" : "Federal Express", "shipCode" : "FedEx"},
              {"shipName" : "United Parcel Service", "shipCode" : "UPS"},
              {"shipName" : "DHL Express", "shipCode" : "DHL"},
            ],
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
The results of selecting multiple values from the `suggest` collection is rendered as a set of semi-colon-separated values:

```
property.value = "FedEx;DHL"
```

#### SUGGEST with Type-Ahead/Auto-Completion Support
The client MAY use the `suggest` element to offer a type-ahead or auto-complete UI experience. When the possible value collection is supplied via the `suggest.resource` object, client applications MAY use the URL template supplied within the HAL-FORMS document to send partial-completion data to the remote resource (via `HTML.GET`). If no URL template is supplied within the `resource.href` property, the client SHOULD NOT attempt repeated requests to the server.

```javascript
{
  "_templates" : {
    "default" : {
      ...
      "properties" : [
        {
          "name" : "shipping", 
          "value" : "FedEx", 
          "type" : "search",
          "prompt" : "Select Shipping Method", 
          "suggest" : {
            "resource" : {
              "href" : "http://api.examples.org/shipping-options{?value},
              "templated" : "true",
              "accept : "text/csv"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The resulting response body SHOULD be a shorter list of possible values filtered by the value passed in the URL.

### Other Considerations

 * Support for the `suggest` object of a `property` element is OPTIONAL. If the client does not understand or cannot parse the `suggest` object, the `suggest` object SHOULD be ignored and the corresponding `property` SHOULD be treated as a simple text input element.

 * The `suggest` element of a `property` MAY appear when the `property.type` attribute is set to `select`, `radio`, `checkbox`, or `search`. If the `suggest.type` value is set to anything else, the client MAY ignore the `suggest` element. 
 
 * If both `inline` and `resource` elements appear in the same `suggest` object, the `inline` element SHOULD be used and the `resource` element SHOULD NOT be used.

 * In cases where the possible value collection only supplies a list of `value` elements, the client SHOULD operate as if a `prompt` element was supplied and set that `prompt` value to equal the contents of the corresponding `value` element.
 
 * Compliant applications SHOULD support both `application/json` and `text/csv` as valid response types for `suggest.resource` implementations. Clients MAY support other values. If no `suggest.accept` attribute exists, the client application SHOULD default to `text/csv`. Whether the `suggest.accept` value appears or not, client applications SHOULD send an `Accept` header when making a request to the server with the supplied URL. If no `Accept` header is sent by the client, the server SHOULD assume the client expects a `text/csv` value and respond accordingly.
 
 * When responding to a `resource.href` request, the server MAY return additional fields (e.g. more than `prompt` and `value` fields). Additional fields SHOULD be ignored by the client application.
